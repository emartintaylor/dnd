		<description>
			<p class="flavor">The warforged were made as the ideal soldiers to serve in the devastating Last War. Although they are constructs, they have much in common with living creatures, including emotions and social bonds, and perhaps even souls.</p>
			<p>As a warforged, you have the following racial traits.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 1.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Size.</span>Warforged are generally broader and heavier than humans. Your size is Medium.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Speed.</span>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Composite Plating.</span>Your construction incorporates wood and metal, granting you a +1 bonus to Armor Class.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Living Construct.</span>Even though you were constructed, you are a living creature. You are immune to disease. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish.<br/>Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Languages.</span>You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.<br/>
